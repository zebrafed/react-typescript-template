# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with some ESLint rules.

# Cypress Testing

- To get started with Cypress testing, run yarn test
- I have provided an example test App.cy.tsx

Note: I have created some definition files for better IDE integration. One of which is cypress.d.ts which I have referenced in tsconfig.app.json

# i18n Integration

Comes setup as standard with i18n and react-i18n. I have already done the setup required to get these translations working with the app and test suite. 

# Provided Scripts (you can alternatively use npm)
- yarn
- yarn dev
- yarn test
